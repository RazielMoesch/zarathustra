### About

My Name is Raziel Moesch (Raz is easier) and I am currently a 17 year old with a fondness for Machine Learning Model Architecture Design (primarily because it's a mouthfull to pronounce, and as such sounds fancy). This library named after the book Thus Spoke Zarathustra, by Friedrich Nietzsche, is an accumulation of the various models and utilities that I have built. By placing them all in well structured, well documented, and simple location I hope that it will make it easier for me and others to use what I have built. If you have any questions regarding me (if you wanna give me a job), the library, or anything else, please reach out to this email: TheRazielMoesch@gmail.com.
